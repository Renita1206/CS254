1) Implement pipe operator with following functionality: 
    The parent process reads in a file "input.txt" and redirects the output to pipe
    The child process reads the contents and performs a line count, space and characters

2)Using pipes, find the sum of an array
    One process reads half the array and stores in pipe
    The second process reads the other half and displays the whole array as output

3)  One process takes 3 strings as input and writes into pipe
    The other process reads from pipe and change the order of string to display
